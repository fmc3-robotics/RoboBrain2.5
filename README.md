## 🔥 Overview
**RoboBrain-2.5** is a next-generation Embodied AI foundation model that significantly evolves its predecessor's core capabilities in general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal data. It achieves a paradigm shift in 3D Spatial Reasoning, transitioning from 2D relative points to predicting 3D coordinates with depth information, understanding absolute metric constraints, and generating complete manipulation trajectories tailored for complex tasks with physical constraints. Furthermore, it establishes a breakthrough in Temporal Value Prediction by constructing a General Reward Modeling Method that provides dense progress tracking and multi-granular execution state estimation across varying viewpoints. This empowers VLA reinforcement learning with immediate, dense feedback signals, enabling robots to achieve high task success rates and robustness in fine-grained manipulation scenarios.

**RoboBrain 2.0**, the previously most powerful open-source embodied brain model. Compared to its predecessor, RoboBrain 1.0, our latest version are designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance 
across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results in most cases, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models.
In particular, it supports key real-world embodied intelligence capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and real-time scene memory). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Comprehensive Upgrade in ✨ Native 3D Spatial Reasoning ✨ 
Compared to version 2.0, **RoboBrain-2.5** achieves a leap in spatial perception and reasoning capabilities:
*   **From 2D to 3D:** Upgraded from predicting coordinate points on 2D images to predicting coordinate points with depth information in **3D space** (3D Spatial Referring).
*   **Relative to Absolute:** Evolved from understanding relative spatial relationships to measuring **absolute 3D spatial metric information** (3D Spatial Measuring). The model can comprehend precise physical constraint instructions (e.g., "hovering 1-5 cm above").
*   **Point to Trace:** Advanced from predicting a single target point for pick-and-place to predicting a **series of key points** that describe the complete manipulation process (3D Spatial Trace), naturally possessing spatial planning capabilities with 3D absolute metrics.


### 2. Breakthrough in ✨ Dense Temporal Value Estimation ✨ 
**RoboBrain-2.5** makes significant progress in temporal modeling by constructing a General Reward Model (GRM):
*   **Dense Progress Prediction:** Capable of multi-granularity task progress prediction across different tasks, viewpoints, and embodiments.
*   **Execution State Estimation:** Understands task goals and estimates various states during execution (e.g., success, failure, error occurrence).
*   **Empowering VLA Reinforcement Learning:** Provides real-time, dense feedback signals and rewards for VLA (Vision-Language-Action) reinforcement learning. With only **one demonstration**, it achieves a task success rate of **95%+** in complex, fine-grained manipulations.

### 3. More Powerful Core Capabilities from previous version 2.0
**RoboBrain 2.5** also maintains the three core capabilities of version 2.0, which supports ***interactive reasoning*** with long-horizon planning and closed-loop feedback, ***spatial perception*** for precise point and bbox prediction from complex instructions, ***temporal perception*** for future trajectory estimation, and ***scene reasoning*** through real-time structured memory construction and update.
